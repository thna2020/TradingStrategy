## A

> Adjusted EPS

Adjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company's net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.

> Anomalies

- 7 market anomalies:
1) Smaller firms (smaller capitalization) tend to outperform larger companies. As anomalies go, the small-firm effect makes sense. A company's economic growth is ultimately the driving force behind its stock performance, and smaller companies have much longer runways for growth than larger companies.
  - A company like Microsoft (MSFT) might need to find an extra $10 billion in sales to grow 10%, while a smaller company might need only an extra $70 million in sales for the same growth rate. Accordingly, smaller firms typically are able to grow much faster than larger companies.
2) January Effect: The idea is that stocks that underperformed in the fourth quarter of the prior year tend to outperform the markets in January. The reason for the January effect is so logical that it is almost hard to call it an anomaly. Investors will often look to jettison underperforming stocks late in the year so that they can use their losses to offset capital gains taxes (or to take the small deduction that the IRS allows if there is a net capital loss for the year). Many people call this event "tax-loss harvesting." As a result, there is excess selling pressure before January and excess buying pressure after January 1, leading to this effect.
3) Low Book Value: stocks with below-average price-to-book ratios tend to outperform the market. Numerous test portfolios have shown that buying a collection of stocks with low price/book ratios will deliver market-beating performance.
4) Neglected Stocks: The neglected-firm effect occurs on stocks that are less liquid (lower trading volume) and tend to have minimal analyst support. The idea here is that as these companies are "discovered" by investors, the stocks will outperform. Many investors monitor long-term purchasing indicators like P/E ratios and RSI. These tell them if a stock has been oversold, and if it might be time to consider loading up on shares. Though their performance appears to be correlated with size, neglected stocks do appear to have lower volatility.
5) Reversals: Some evidence suggests that stocks at either end of the performance spectrum, over periods of time (generally a year), do tend to reverse course in the following period—yesterday's top performers become tomorrow's underperformers, and vice versa.
  - Not only does statistical evidence back this up, but the anomaly also makes sense according to investment fundamentals. If a stock is a top performer in the market, odds are that its performance has made it expensive; likewise, the reverse is true for underperformers. It would seem like common sense, then, to expect that the overpriced stocks would underperform (bringing their valuation back in line) while the underpriced stocks outperform.
  - Reversals also likely work in part because people expect them to work. If enough investors habitually sell last year's winners and buy last year's losers, that will help move the stocks in exactly the expected directions, making it something of a self-fulfilling anomaly.
 6) Days of the Week: Efficient market supporters hate the "days of the week" anomaly because it not only appears to be true, but it also makes no sense. Research has shown that stocks tend to move more on Fridays than Mondays and that there is a bias toward positive market performance on Fridays. It is not a huge discrepancy, but it is a persistent one.
  - On a fundamental level, there is no particular reason that this should be true. Some psychological factors could be at work. Perhaps an end-of-week optimism permeates the market as traders and investors look forward to the weekend. Alternatively, perhaps the weekend gives investors a chance to catch up on their reading, stew and fret about the market, and develop pessimism going into Monday.
7) Dogs of the Dow: The idea behind this theory was basically that investors could beat the market by selecting stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that had certain value attributes.
  - Investors practiced different versions of the approach, but there were two common approaches. The first is to select the 10 highest-yielding Dow stocks. The second method is to go a step further and take the five stocks from that list with the lowest absolute stock price and hold them for a year.
  - To some extent, this is simply a modified version of the reversal anomaly; the Dow stocks with the highest yields probably were relative underperformers and would be expected to outperform.

> Asset bubble

- An asset bubble occurs when the price of an asset, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities, rises at a rapid pace without underlying fundamentals to justify the price spike.

## B

## C

> Correlation

> Crude oil

A fall in logistics cost lowers their final price and raises demand for goods. This, in turn, raises the stock price. At the same time, when crude oil prices go up, it increases the cost of production of goods which can negatively impact their stock prices.

> Cumulative return

- Cumulative return is the return on the investment in total. For instance, the money gained in the first year of an investment would be the annualized return. The total return of investment accumulated at the end of the second year would be the cumulative return.
- S&P 500: $100 in 2000 → $448.08 in 2023
  - This is a return on investment of 348.08%, or 6.71% per year. This lump-sum investment beats inflation during this period for an inflation-adjusted return of about 157.91% cumulatively, or 4.19% per year.

## D

> Dividends

- Companies that increase their dividends send a positive signal to investors and analysts that the company can maintain growth and profitability into the future. 1 As a way to distribute profits to shareholders, dividend increases can attract new investors who seek income in addition to capital gains in their portfolio.
  - Companies that increase their dividend payments year after year are usually less volatile than the broader market. Some companies also respond to inflation by raising dividend payments. And the steady income from dividends can help smooth out a stock's total return.

> Dotted line

- The dotted line on the graphs shows you at what stock price the market closed the day before.

## E

> EM

- Emerging markets are countries with some characteristics of a developed market but are not yet fully developed. These countries have rapid GDP growth and industrialization, growing per capita income, increasing debt and equity markets liquidity, and established financial system infrastructures.
- There are many emerging markets around the world, but the four largest are known as the "BRICs" (an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Many investors believe that these markets are relatively stable and may eventually replace the G7 as the world's next superpowers.
- From a trading perspective, emerging markets are simply another place to seek out opportunities. Emerging economies tend to be more volatile because of instabilities in the financial or political climate, but these can also offer high rates of returns on associated investments.

## F

> Form 3F

- Reports on Form 13F are intended to increase the public availability of information on the securities holdings of institutional investors. Under Exchange Act Rule 13f-1, in general an institutional investment manager is either: An entity that invests in, or buys and sells, securities for its own account.

> FX headwind

- FX headwinds refer to the negative impact that foreign exchange (FX) movements can have on a company's financial performance. FX headwinds occur when the value of a company's domestic currency declines relative to the currencies of its key trading partners. This can result in higher costs for the company, as it has to pay more for goods and services priced in foreign currencies.

- For example, if a company is based in the United States and generates revenue in euros, a weakening of the dollar relative to the euro will result in lower revenue when translated back into dollars. This is known as an FX headwind.

- FX headwinds can be particularly challenging for multinational companies that operate in multiple countries and generate revenue in different currencies. In such cases, the company is exposed to FX risk, which can result in significant volatility in its earnings.

- To mitigate FX headwinds, companies can use hedging strategies to lock in exchange rates and reduce the impact of FX movements on their financial performance. For example, a company may use currency forwards, options, or swaps to hedge against unfavorable exchange rate movements.

- It is important to note that FX headwinds are just one of many factors that can impact a company's financial performance, and their impact can vary greatly depending on the company's specific circumstances and the state of the global economy.

## G

> Golden Cross

A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.
- A golden cross is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a major rally.
- The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.
- The golden cross can be contrasted with a death cross indicating a bearish price movement.

> JEPI

- JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF: low volatility but high yield in 2022.


## K

## L

> Long vs. short

Having a “long” position in a security means that you own the security. Investors maintain “long” security positions in the expectation that the stock will rise in value in the future. The opposite of a “long” position is a “short” position. A "short" position is generally the sale of a stock you do not own.

## M

> Margin

- Margin trading refers to borrowing money from the broker to purchase stock. The investor is allowed to buy more securities than what he can afford with the available funds at the moment.

> Margin call

- Many margin investors are familiar with the "routine" margin call, where the broker asks for additional funds when the equity in the customer's account declines below certain required levels. Normally, the broker will allow from two to five days to meet the call.
- You have $20,000 worth of securities bought using $10,000 borrowed and $10,000 in cash. When the margin requirement is 30% and the value of the securities drop by 40% to $12,000, since the amount you borrowed from your broker stays at $10,000, your own equity becomes $2,000 which is lower than the 30% minimum margin requirement.
  - $2,000 / $12,000 = 16.6% < 30%
- A margin call occurs when the percentage of the equity in the account drops below the maintenance margin requirement.
- How much is the margin call?
  - $12,000*30% = $3600 → amount of equity you were required to maintain.
  - $3600 - $2000 = $1600 → You will have a $1,600 margin call.
- A margin call can be covered through: Depositing additional funds to meet the account's maintenance margin requirement; Depositing unmargined securities to meet the account's maintenance margin requirement; or Selling margined securities to meet the account's maintenance margin requirement.

> Meme stocks

- Simply put, meme stocks skyrocket in price in a short period (often hours or days) because of a sudden surge in interest online or on social media and subsequent buying among small individual investors. These short-term surges can often reverse course just as quickly, though, making meme stocks far more volatile than average stock market moves.
- GameStop (GME) is widely regarded as the first meme stock, whose stock price rose as much as 100× over the course of several months as members of its meme community crafted a spectacular short squeeze.

> Mode

## N

## O

> Options

-  Basically, when the market believes a stock will be very volatile, the time value of the option rises. On the other hand, when the market believes a stock will be less volatile, the time value of the option falls. The expectation by the market of a stock's future volatility is key to the price of options.

> OTC

- Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are securities that are not listed on a major exchange in the United States and are instead traded via a broker-dealer network, usually because many are smaller companies and do not meet the requirements to be listed on a formal exchange. There may be additional steps and fees when trading OTC securities because trades must be made through market makers who carry an inventory of securities to facilitate trading.
- Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades for securities are transacted via a dealer network as opposed to on a centralized exchange such as NYSE. 

> Outperform the market

- Alpha Picks has surged 25.52% in total vs just 8.76% for the S&P 500. That means it’s outperforming the market by 16.76%!
- Portfolio up 10% vs 5% for the S&P 500 &rarr; outperform the market by 5%.


## P

> P/E 

- Price to earnings ratio, or P/E, is a way to value a company by comparing the price of a stock to its earnings. The P/E equals the price of a share of stock, divided by the company's earnings-per-share. It tells you how much you are paying for each dollar of earnings.

> Pullback

Pullbacks are a short-term, temporary drop in the price of an asset like stock during a longer-term uptrend. 
Investors targeting a particular asset can find buying opportunities during pullbacks, although they would need to weigh other factors.
--> Buy on pullback

> Put-call ratio

- The put-call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options. A put-call ratio of 1 indicates that the number of buyers of calls is the same as the number of buyers for puts.

> Put vs call options

- A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price (the strike price) before the option's expiration date. A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) prior to its expiration date.

## Q

> Quant rating

- Quant rating is a type of investment analysis that uses mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions. The goal of quant rating is to identify stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments that are likely to perform well in the future based on a range of numerical and statistical factors.

- Quant rating systems analyze large amounts of data, such as financial statements, market trends, and economic indicators, to determine the potential for investment returns. The data is processed using algorithms and mathematical models to produce a quantitative score or rating for each security.

- Quant rating is a popular tool for investment managers, who use it to build portfolios, make investment decisions, and monitor the performance of their investments. Quant rating is also used by individual investors who are looking for a systematic and objective approach to investment analysis.

- It is important to note that quant rating is just one of many approaches to investment analysis, and it is not a guarantee of investment success. Like any investment strategy, quant rating has its limitations, and it may not be suitable for all types of investors.

## R

> REIT

- REITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors.

> Risk-to-reward ratio

- If you have a risk-reward ratio of 1:3, it means you're risking $1 to potentially make $3. If you have a risk-reward ratio of 1:5, it means you're risking $1 to potentially make $5. You get my point. “You need a minimum of 1:2 risk reward ratio.”

> RSI

- The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.
- An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.
- The RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above oversold line is often seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell.
- The RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets.

## S

> Sell-side equity research

The general public sees equity research analysts on CNBC explaining their “buy” “sell” or “hold” recommendations on stocks, but the real audience for sell-side equity research is “the buy side” — the investment bank’s institutional clients.

> Short interest

- Short interest indicates how many shares of a company are currently sold short and not yet covered.
- An increase in short interest often signals that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest shows that they have become more bullish.
- If the short interest for a stock rises from 10% to 20%, it may be a warning sign that negative sentiment is growing toward the company, as the number of investors who expect the stock price to decrease has doubled.
- The short interest ratio represents the number of days it takes short sellers on average to cover their positions, that is repurchase all of the borrowed shares. 

> Short position

- A short position is one that bets against the market, profiting when prices decline. To sell short is to take such a bet. This is opposed to a long position, which involves buying an asset in hopes that the price will rise.
- A short, or a short position, is created when a trader **sells a security first** with the intention of repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price.

> Short sales

- Short selling involves borrowing a security whose price you think is going to fall from your brokerage and selling it on the open market. Your plan is to then buy the same stock back later, hopefully for a lower price than you initially sold it for, and pocket the difference after repaying the initial loan.

> Short squeeze

- In the stock market, a short squeeze is a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals.
- A short squeeze happens when many investors bet against a stock and its price shoots up instead. A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short sellers bail out to cut their losses. Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.
- If a stock's price rises quickly, then short sellers sometimes scramble to close out their positions as rapidly as possible. A high volume of investors who are shorting a stock and racing to exit their positions at the same time creates a short squeeze.

> Skew & kurtios

> SPAC

- A special purpose acquisition company, also known as a "blank check company", is a shell corporation listed on a stock exchange with the purpose of acquiring a private company, thus making it public without going through the traditional initial public offering process and the associated regulations thereof.

> Standard deviation

> Stop loss

- A stop-loss order instructs that a stock be bought or sold when it reaches a specified price known as the stop price. 

## T

> Tight market

A tight market refers to a trading environment in which the price difference between the best bid and offer is very small. Tight markets tend to occur in highly liquid, high-volume blue-chip stocks where there is an abundance of buyers and sellers at all times.

> Trading range

- Trading range refers to the difference between the high and low prices in a given trading period. Range-bound trading is characterized by prices staying in a definable range over time. A trading range is characterized by both a support price and a resistance price, between which the price tends to fluctuate.

> Trending market

- A trending market is when a price series continually closes either higher or lower over a number of periods.
