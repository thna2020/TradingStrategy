## A

> Adjusted EPS

Adjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company's net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.

> Crude oil

A fall in logistics cost lowers their final price and raises demand for goods. This, in turn, raises the stock price. At the same time, when crude oil prices go up, it increases the cost of production of goods which can negatively impact their stock prices.

## D

> Dividends

- Companies that increase their dividends send a positive signal to investors and analysts that the company can maintain growth and profitability into the future. 1 As a way to distribute profits to shareholders, dividend increases can attract new investors who seek income in addition to capital gains in their portfolio.
  - Companies that increase their dividend payments year after year are usually less volatile than the broader market. Some companies also respond to inflation by raising dividend payments. And the steady income from dividends can help smooth out a stock's total return.

## E

> EM

- Emerging markets are countries with some characteristics of a developed market but are not yet fully developed. These countries have rapid GDP growth and industrialization, growing per capita income, increasing debt and equity markets liquidity, and established financial system infrastructures.
- There are many emerging markets around the world, but the four largest are known as the "BRICs" (an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Many investors believe that these markets are relatively stable and may eventually replace the G7 as the world's next superpowers.
- From a trading perspective, emerging markets are simply another place to seek out opportunities. Emerging economies tend to be more volatile because of instabilities in the financial or political climate, but these can also offer high rates of returns on associated investments.

## F

> Form 3F

- Reports on Form 13F are intended to increase the public availability of information on the securities holdings of institutional investors. Under Exchange Act Rule 13f-1, in general an institutional investment manager is either: An entity that invests in, or buys and sells, securities for its own account.

> FX headwind

- FX headwinds refer to the negative impact that foreign exchange (FX) movements can have on a company's financial performance. FX headwinds occur when the value of a company's domestic currency declines relative to the currencies of its key trading partners. This can result in higher costs for the company, as it has to pay more for goods and services priced in foreign currencies.

- For example, if a company is based in the United States and generates revenue in euros, a weakening of the dollar relative to the euro will result in lower revenue when translated back into dollars. This is known as an FX headwind.

- FX headwinds can be particularly challenging for multinational companies that operate in multiple countries and generate revenue in different currencies. In such cases, the company is exposed to FX risk, which can result in significant volatility in its earnings.

- To mitigate FX headwinds, companies can use hedging strategies to lock in exchange rates and reduce the impact of FX movements on their financial performance. For example, a company may use currency forwards, options, or swaps to hedge against unfavorable exchange rate movements.

- It is important to note that FX headwinds are just one of many factors that can impact a company's financial performance, and their impact can vary greatly depending on the company's specific circumstances and the state of the global economy.

## G

> Golden Cross

A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.
- A golden cross is a technical chart pattern indicating the potential for a major rally.
- The golden cross appears on a chart when a stock’s short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.
- The golden cross can be contrasted with a death cross indicating a bearish price movement.

## K

## L

> Long vs. short

Having a “long” position in a security means that you own the security. Investors maintain “long” security positions in the expectation that the stock will rise in value in the future. The opposite of a “long” position is a “short” position. A "short" position is generally the sale of a stock you do not own.

## O

> Options

-  Basically, when the market believes a stock will be very volatile, the time value of the option rises. On the other hand, when the market believes a stock will be less volatile, the time value of the option falls. The expectation by the market of a stock's future volatility is key to the price of options.

> OTC

- Over-the-counter (OTC) securities are securities that are not listed on a major exchange in the United States and are instead traded via a broker-dealer network, usually because many are smaller companies and do not meet the requirements to be listed on a formal exchange. There may be additional steps and fees when trading OTC securities because trades must be made through market makers who carry an inventory of securities to facilitate trading. 

## P

> Pullback

Pullbacks are a short-term, temporary drop in the price of an asset like stock during a longer-term uptrend. 
Investors targeting a particular asset can find buying opportunities during pullbacks, although they would need to weigh other factors.
--> Buy on pullback

## Q

> Quant rating

- Quant rating is a type of investment analysis that uses mathematical models and algorithms to make investment decisions. The goal of quant rating is to identify stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments that are likely to perform well in the future based on a range of numerical and statistical factors.

- Quant rating systems analyze large amounts of data, such as financial statements, market trends, and economic indicators, to determine the potential for investment returns. The data is processed using algorithms and mathematical models to produce a quantitative score or rating for each security.

- Quant rating is a popular tool for investment managers, who use it to build portfolios, make investment decisions, and monitor the performance of their investments. Quant rating is also used by individual investors who are looking for a systematic and objective approach to investment analysis.

- It is important to note that quant rating is just one of many approaches to investment analysis, and it is not a guarantee of investment success. Like any investment strategy, quant rating has its limitations, and it may not be suitable for all types of investors.

## R

> REIT

- REITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors.

> Risk-to-reward ratio

- If you have a risk-reward ratio of 1:3, it means you're risking $1 to potentially make $3. If you have a risk-reward ratio of 1:5, it means you're risking $1 to potentially make $5. You get my point. “You need a minimum of 1:2 risk reward ratio.”

## S

> Sell-side equity research

The general public sees equity research analysts on CNBC explaining their “buy” “sell” or “hold” recommendations on stocks, but the real audience for sell-side equity research is “the buy side” — the investment bank’s institutional clients.

> Short interest

- Short interest indicates how many shares of a company are currently sold short and not yet covered.
- An increase in short interest often signals that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest shows that they have become more bullish.
- If the short interest for a stock rises from 10% to 20%, it may be a warning sign that negative sentiment is growing toward the company, as the number of investors who expect the stock price to decrease has doubled.
- The short interest ratio represents the number of days it takes short sellers on average to cover their positions, that is repurchase all of the borrowed shares. 

> Short sales

Short selling involves borrowing a security whose price you think is going to fall from your brokerage and selling it on the open market. Your plan is to then buy the same stock back later, hopefully for a lower price than you initially sold it for, and pocket the difference after repaying the initial loan.
