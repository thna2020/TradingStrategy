## A

> Adjusted EPS

Adjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring. For instance, if the company's net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.

> Crude oil

A fall in logistics cost lowers their final price and raises demand for goods. This, in turn, raises the stock price. At the same time, when crude oil prices go up, it increases the cost of production of goods which can negatively impact their stock prices.

Investors targeting a particular asset can find buying opportunities during pullbacks, although they would need to weigh other factors.

> Sell-side equity research

The general public sees equity research analysts on CNBC explaining their “buy” “sell” or “hold” recommendations on stocks, but the real audience for sell-side equity research is “the buy side” — the investment bank’s institutional clients.

> Short sales

Short selling involves borrowing a security whose price you think is going to fall from your brokerage and selling it on the open market. Your plan is to then buy the same stock back later, hopefully for a lower price than you initially sold it for, and pocket the difference after repaying the initial loan.
