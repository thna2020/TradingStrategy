### Week 1

Indices: S&P 500 (^SPX) (4k) (up), Nasdaq (^IXIC) (11.5k) (up), Dow (^DJI)(34k)(up)

Picks: SPOT (up 13% 1-day, up 38% YTD), GM (up 8% 1-day, up 16% YTD)

- Both premium and ad-supported tiers demolished estimates and posted record quarterly growth for the Swedish king of sound.
- Monthly active users hit 489mn, 20% annualized growth, while Premium users grew to 205mn, posting 14% growth.

- For a boomer-a** automaker to speed over 8% in one day, something as eye-catching as a car accident must’ve happened. GM eviscerated estimates for the quarter, posting EPS of $2.12 vs. $1.68 expected while beating by nearly 10% on revenue estimates as well.
- Mostly, that was due to egregiously low expectations set by analysts. Profits still fell annually, and the firm guided for continued margin pressures in FY’23. But because everyone was expecting this thing to go up in smoke, they managed to have themselves a day.

- Sure, beating on sales is cool, but Wall Street is still gonna throw up if you can’t deliver on the bottom line (unless ofc you’re a hot, sexy tech stock like Spotify). Don’t get me wrong; earnings still grew at a solid pace, just not fast enough.

On Tuesday, AMD said it expected $5.3 billion in sales in the March quarter, which would be a 10% year-over-year decline in sales.
Intel guided last week to about $11 billion in sales, which would be a 40% year-over-year decline.

Higher rates = less money to go around = fewer projects to work on = fewer employees needed.

- Most people earn income from wages
- People want the highest wages possible (obviously)
- But the higher their wages, the higher the costs of goods & services will be
- So, higher wages drive inflation, which after adjusting for inflation, ends up being little to no real income gain in the long run

Picks: PTON (up 26% 1-day, up 100% YTD), META (up 3% 1-day, up 22% YTD)

- PTON still (very) unprofitable, losing $0.98/sh vs. $0.64/sh expected, but when you’re down so bad, it doesn’t take much to lift you up.
- Following Peloton’s playbook of lowering expectations so much that even trash results don’t look like a total dumpster fire, shares in Meta are absolutely popping off after hours.
- But the real kicker was the $40bn (not a typo) in buybacks the firm has authorized. That’s equivalent to ~10% of shares outstanding and earns the firm a spot in the Buyback Hall of Fame.

---

- Stocks fell Friday as a much stronger than expected jobs report worried some investors that the Federal Reserve would keep hiking interest rates. 
- the Nasdaq surged 3.3% for a fifth straight weekly advance thanks to strong earnings from some major tech companies
- **Automotive**: Toyota (NYSE:TM) not only defended its title as the world's top-selling automaker for a third year in a row, but did so by a wide margin. Including subsidiaries Hino Motors and Daihatsu, group sales reached 10.5M vehicles in 2022, compared to the 8.3M of its second-ranked rival Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY). The news comes after Toyota shocked the industry with its first CEO transition in 14 years that could indicate a stronger focus on next-generation vehicles.
- Back from the edge of the metaverse, social media giant Meta Platforms (META) soared more than 20% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as investors renewed their confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Helping the situation was a big revenue beat, as well as a massive $40B share buyback program. Meta also released a forecast for FQ1 revenue that could reach as high as $28.5B, which would top sales seen during Q1 of 2021 (and was right before Apple's (AAPL) privacy measures heavily dented its ad revenues).
  - anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89-95 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $94-100 billion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue.

### Week 4
- it helps to remember that the market’s least favorite thing isn’t necessarily bad news but overall uncertainty.
  -  Many have spun the theory that because the Russian invasion in Ukraine is likely just getting underway, traders have lost faith in the idea that JPow’s gonna jack up the fed funds rate to 50 bps at the end of March. Now, all signs point to a “calm” 25 bps jump.
- SWIFT is a messaging system banks use to coordinate transactions, and Russia’s elimination from the network would’ve added friction to the global financial system.
- Avoid buying the "dip" and then dipping to the dip of the dippity dip dip
- Monday: As usual, today’s gonna be the slowest day of the week. 
- Tuesday: Tuesday’s a bit more fun from a macro perspective. Trade balances, including US imports and exports, will drop along with the Small Business Optimism Index. Some not-so-small businesses will be reporting earnings, however, including SoFi, Baidu, Salesforce, Target, and (please keep it in your pants) AMC. 
- Wednesday: On Wednesday, housing will steal the spotlight. Even more exciting, the IEA will reveal a bunch of global energy bullsh-t and how Russia has ruined that so far. Company earnings include Veeva, Okta, and Snowflake.
- Thursday: Pre-Friday is always fun. On the earnings side, Kroger, Costco, Best Buy, and Gap will give us a taste of how retail has been doing over the last quarter.
- Friday: the University of Michigan drops the latest consumer sentiment data at 8:30 a.m. Alongside, a few companies you’ve never heard of release earnings.
  - Etsy: up 16.2% Pandemic or not, consumers seem to enjoy the dazzlingly random selection of goods and other bullsh*t that Etsy lives on.
  - Molson Coors: Investors were so excited that no one even cared about how badly they missed both earnings and revenue. Shares were up 7.1% on Friday.
  - Beyond Meat: it looks like consumers aren’t nearly as excited about fake meat as investors once were. Shares in plant-based “meat” maker Beyond Meat started their publicly traded journey on a massive high, but it’s been all downhill since.
  - Foot Locker: On a day in which 97% of S&P 500 stocks rose, you have to do something truly horrendous to plummet 29.8%. Unfortunately, Foot Locker did just that. 
    - In a brutal showing of “you need me more than I need you,” an announcement revealed that Nike’s focus on selling DTC rather than in retail stores like Foot Locker will result in a significant drop in Nike products going to these locations.
