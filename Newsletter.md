### Week 1

- Both premium and ad-supported tiers demolished estimates and posted record quarterly growth for the Swedish king of sound.
- Monthly active users hit 489mn, 20% annualized growth, while Premium users grew to 205mn, posting 14% growth.

- For a boomer-a** automaker to speed over 8% in one day, something as eye-catching as a car accident must’ve happened. GM eviscerated estimates for the quarter, posting EPS of $2.12 vs. $1.68 expected while beating by nearly 10% on revenue estimates as well.
- Mostly, that was due to egregiously low expectations set by analysts. Profits still fell annually, and the firm guided for continued margin pressures in FY’23. But because everyone was expecting this thing to go up in smoke, they managed to have themselves a day.

- Sure, beating on sales is cool, but Wall Street is still gonna throw up if you can’t deliver on the bottom line (unless ofc you’re a hot, sexy tech stock like Spotify). Don’t get me wrong; earnings still grew at a solid pace, just not fast enough.

On Tuesday, AMD said it expected $5.3 billion in sales in the March quarter, which would be a 10% year-over-year decline in sales.
Intel guided last week to about $11 billion in sales, which would be a 40% year-over-year decline.

Higher rates = less money to go around = fewer projects to work on = fewer employees needed.

- Most people earn income from wages
- People want the highest wages possible (obviously)
- But the higher their wages, the higher the costs of goods & services will be
- So, higher wages drive inflation, which after adjusting for inflation, ends up being little to no real income gain in the long run
