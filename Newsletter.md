### Week 1

Indices: S&P 500 (^SPX) (4k) (up), Nasdaq (^IXIC) (11.5k) (up), Dow (^DJI)(34k)(up)

Picks: SPOT (up 13% 1-day, up 38% YTD), GM (up 8% 1-day, up 16% YTD)

- Both premium and ad-supported tiers demolished estimates and posted record quarterly growth for the Swedish king of sound.
- Monthly active users hit 489mn, 20% annualized growth, while Premium users grew to 205mn, posting 14% growth.

- For a boomer-a** automaker to speed over 8% in one day, something as eye-catching as a car accident must’ve happened. GM eviscerated estimates for the quarter, posting EPS of $2.12 vs. $1.68 expected while beating by nearly 10% on revenue estimates as well.
- Mostly, that was due to egregiously low expectations set by analysts. Profits still fell annually, and the firm guided for continued margin pressures in FY’23. But because everyone was expecting this thing to go up in smoke, they managed to have themselves a day.

- Sure, beating on sales is cool, but Wall Street is still gonna throw up if you can’t deliver on the bottom line (unless ofc you’re a hot, sexy tech stock like Spotify). Don’t get me wrong; earnings still grew at a solid pace, just not fast enough.

On Tuesday, AMD said it expected $5.3 billion in sales in the March quarter, which would be a 10% year-over-year decline in sales.
Intel guided last week to about $11 billion in sales, which would be a 40% year-over-year decline.

Higher rates = less money to go around = fewer projects to work on = fewer employees needed.

- Most people earn income from wages
- People want the highest wages possible (obviously)
- But the higher their wages, the higher the costs of goods & services will be
- So, higher wages drive inflation, which after adjusting for inflation, ends up being little to no real income gain in the long run

---

Picks: PTON (up 26% 1-day, up 100% YTD), META (up 3% 1-day, up 22% YTD)

- PTON still (very) unprofitable, losing $0.98/sh vs. $0.64/sh expected, but when you’re down so bad, it doesn’t take much to lift you up.
- Following Peloton’s playbook of lowering expectations so much that even trash results don’t look like a total dumpster fire, shares in Meta are absolutely popping off after hours.
- But the real kicker was the $40bn (not a typo) in buybacks the firm has authorized. That’s equivalent to ~10% of shares outstanding and earns the firm a spot in the Buyback Hall of Fame.

---

- Stocks fell Friday as a much stronger than expected jobs report worried some investors that the Federal Reserve would keep hiking interest rates. 
- the Nasdaq surged 3.3% for a fifth straight weekly advance thanks to strong earnings from some major tech companies
- **Automotive**: Toyota (NYSE:TM) not only defended its title as the world's top-selling automaker for a third year in a row, but did so by a wide margin. Including subsidiaries Hino Motors and Daihatsu, group sales reached 10.5M vehicles in 2022, compared to the 8.3M of its second-ranked rival Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY). The news comes after Toyota shocked the industry with its first CEO transition in 14 years that could indicate a stronger focus on next-generation vehicles.
- Back from the edge of the metaverse, social media giant Meta Platforms (META) soared more than 20% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as investors renewed their confidence in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Helping the situation was a big revenue beat, as well as a massive $40B share buyback program. Meta also released a forecast for FQ1 revenue that could reach as high as $28.5B, which would top sales seen during Q1 of 2021 (and was right before Apple's (AAPL) privacy measures heavily dented its ad revenues).
  - anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will be in the range of $89-95 billion, lowered from our prior outlook of $94-100 billion due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue.

### Week 3

- Supply-and-demand is the law of the land, but outsized shifts in pricing tend to be sticky, regardless of the type of good or service. In short, it’s unlikely that you’ll see prices move back down to February of 2020 levels. Ever.
- As prices go up, real wages are being flushed down the toilet.
- What some consumers don’t realize is that their credit card APRs are going to shift as the Fed jacks up interest rates to fight inflation. Not only are you paying exorbitant prices, but you’re also about to start paying (even) more in interest when you send off those e-payments to your credit cards. If you thought paying CC interest was a good deal at 17% APR, you’re going to love it at 30%. That’s the reality that some consumers are about to enter.
- APPL +: consultants are predicting that back-to-school spending will reach an all-time high this year. Congress wants to regulate Big Tech, but it turns out that voters don’t really care. That’s good for Apple.
- COST +
- NVAX -: super late to market. So late that their vax probably won’t be widely distributed in the West at premium prices. Their shares collapsed 26.20% on Thursday.
- For many businesses, this means controlling their expenditures. Cutting costs might not be enough, so we might end up seeing some drastic measures.
- Hiring freezes are likely going to become pretty popular, even amid a very, very, very tight labor market. 
- probably see delayed or even canceled CapEx, depending on the urgency of that particular project.
- For the investor who has never had to watch their money move through a bear market or a recession, now is likely not the time to test your limits.
- 'd argue that you should know your strengths and weaknesses from a trading perspective and try to stick to a strategy in line with something you know and understand.
## May

### Week 4

- Futures yesterday were under pressure ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes release.
- Some of you have never experienced a tightening cycle, so I’d encourage you to pay attention to the news from the various sources as well as read the guidance from the committee and JPow directly.
- Last month’s 50 bps rate hike was the largest in 22 years, but we’re also dealing with inflation that is higher than we have seen in the last 40 years.
- Nordstrom JWN: Nordstrom’s guidance stated that the consumer wasn’t yet affected by inflation and that they still wanted fancy clothes to wear to fancy events. They had a good quarter, and they posted a beat and raise for the remainder of their fiscal year. JWN was up almost 10% pre-market and ended the day up 14.02%.
- Best Buy BBY: Best Buy beat expectations for both top and bottom line estimates, sending shares ripping during yesterday’s session. Even in a quarter where revenue declined, they still topped what Wall Street was predicting.
  - Their leadership thinks that softer demand is here to stay for a while, but they’re not taking their foot off the gas. They expect to continue selling electronics merch that is central to our lives in the digital age.
- Procter & Gamble (PG): The maker of your toothpaste was the biggest loser in the Dow yesterday, slipping 1.64%. A value name that still delivers some decent yield, the tide pod distributor is actually not having a terrible year. 
- “Gentlemen prefer bonds.” — Andrew Mellon

## Mar

### Week 1

- Rate hikes generally lead to lower stock valuations, but when you’re expecting a hike of 50bps and the damn Chairman of the Fed says, “Nah fam, we’re only raising by half that,” people get excited.
- Nordstrom (JWN): Shares ripped nearly 40% by midday to close up 37.8% on one impressive earnings call. EPS trounced expectations, registering $1.23/sh vs. $1.02 expected, and revenue beat by a cool $80mn as well.
  - Sweetening the pie, guidance was higher than expectations, leading many analysts to raise price targets. Not bad for a clothing retailer in the age of Amazon. I guess it’s savvy inventory management FTW!
- “Betting against entrepreneurs who are changing the world has never been a profitable endeavor.” — Chamath Palihapitiya

- the selloff in tech overwhelmed other sectors given the dominance in market cap the sector commands. This led the Nasdaq to tumble 1.56%, while the other indexes held up a little better. The S&P fell 0.53% while the Dow dropped a mere 0.29%.
- Already, the added friction in the global financial system has been the root of increasing commodity costs. 
- Companies like Apple, Ford, Dell, and Exxon pulling products from the Russian market and supply chain constraints will likely translate to further price increases.
- Either way, oil went negative in 2020, so nothing should surprise us anymore.
- Splunk up 6% 
  - The machine-software firm reported an adjusted EPS of $0.66, while the Street was expecting a loss of $0.22. Further, revenue for the quarter smashed both analysts and management expectations, raking in $901mn vs. $777mn anticipated.
  - Any other day where there’s not a massive tech selloff and this stock is up 20% at least. 
- Kroger KR: Calling this a solid report would be an understatement. The grocer reported an income of $0.91/sh on $33bn in sales, while analysts were looking for just $0.71/sh on similar sales figures, which led to a monstrous 11.6% one-day gain, the company’s largest since god damn 1993.
- Snowflake SNOW: 
  - Slowing revenue, that’s what's going on. Down from 110% last quarter, sales only grew 101% in Q4 on an annualized basis. Equally as disgusting, gross margins came in a massive 90bps lower than expectations. Just disgusting. 
  - 101% sales growth and a slight margin miss? Damn right the stock was down 15.6% yesterday.
- RIVN: Tuesday’s announcement from Rivian of a roughly 20% price increase on future and already placed orders on their soon-to-be produced trucks has been quickly overturned. --> lose-lose-lose

## Feb

### Week 4
- it helps to remember that the market’s least favorite thing isn’t necessarily bad news but overall uncertainty.
  -  Many have spun the theory that because the Russian invasion in Ukraine is likely just getting underway, traders have lost faith in the idea that JPow’s gonna jack up the fed funds rate to 50 bps at the end of March. Now, all signs point to a “calm” 25 bps jump.
- SWIFT is a messaging system banks use to coordinate transactions, and Russia’s elimination from the network would’ve added friction to the global financial system.
- Avoid buying the "dip" and then dipping to the dip of the dippity dip dip
- Monday: As usual, today’s gonna be the slowest day of the week. 
- Tuesday: Tuesday’s a bit more fun from a macro perspective. Trade balances, including US imports and exports, will drop along with the Small Business Optimism Index. Some not-so-small businesses will be reporting earnings, however, including SoFi, Baidu, Salesforce, Target, and (please keep it in your pants) AMC. 
- Wednesday: On Wednesday, housing will steal the spotlight. Even more exciting, the IEA will reveal a bunch of global energy bullsh-t and how Russia has ruined that so far. Company earnings include Veeva, Okta, and Snowflake.
- Thursday: Pre-Friday is always fun. On the earnings side, Kroger, Costco, Best Buy, and Gap will give us a taste of how retail has been doing over the last quarter.
- Friday: the University of Michigan drops the latest consumer sentiment data at 8:30 a.m. Alongside, a few companies you’ve never heard of release earnings.
  - Etsy: up 16.2% Pandemic or not, consumers seem to enjoy the dazzlingly random selection of goods and other bullsh*t that Etsy lives on.
  - Molson Coors: Investors were so excited that no one even cared about how badly they missed both earnings and revenue. Shares were up 7.1% on Friday.
  - Beyond Meat: it looks like consumers aren’t nearly as excited about fake meat as investors once were. Shares in plant-based “meat” maker Beyond Meat started their publicly traded journey on a massive high, but it’s been all downhill since.
  - Foot Locker: On a day in which 97% of S&P 500 stocks rose, you have to do something truly horrendous to plummet 29.8%. Unfortunately, Foot Locker did just that. 
    - In a brutal showing of “you need me more than I need you,” an announcement revealed that Nike’s focus on selling DTC rather than in retail stores like Foot Locker will result in a significant drop in Nike products going to these locations.
- As they do each year, the aforementioned MIT Tech Review breaks down what they believe will be the most disruptive/game-changing technology of the coming year.
- You need to be decisive, open-minded, flexible and competitive. If you're early on in your career and they give you a choice between a great mentor or higher pay, take the mentor every time.” — Stanley Druckenmiller
