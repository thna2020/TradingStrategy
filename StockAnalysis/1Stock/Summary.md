## Luxury

- They’re high-end products that consumers want but don’t need. 
- They’re also distinct from commodity products (such as bananas or gasoline) that are not easily distinguished by brand.
- Luxury goods are more expensive than competing products, but they are perceived as higher quality and confer status on the owner. 
  - Because of that relationship, brand is a crucial component of a luxury stock.
- The best luxury stocks include strong brands, high operating margins, and timeless products.

### Ferrari

- Ferrari, the high-end sports car maker, employs a classic luxury selling technique.
- The company limits its production to support high prices and wide operating margins. 
- Artificial scarcity, as this strategy is known, helps create demand for a product as it becomes an exclusive status symbol. 
- Since not everyone can have one, people naturally want it more.
- Ferrari’s management has argued that the company should be valued more like a luxury company than an automaker, and it earns a higher multiple than its auto sector peers. 
- Like LVMH, the company has found a ripe market in China, and it’s burnished its profits by selling limited-edition cars at prices topping $1 million.
- Performance remains strong through the first half of 2022 with revenue up 21% to $2.5 billion, and it reported a 25% operating margin.
